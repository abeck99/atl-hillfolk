  quote: "For as long as our history goes, our anscestors lived and died by the sword, and kept their honor all the same. This tragedy is the price we pay for our life, and we cannot change who we are because of it. If anything, it should inspire us to not be content with such small victories as can sustain us for a summer. God has promised us so much more!"

  events:
    - "What was expected to be a simple raid against a small Trident village goes bad, and fast. The Shell-Grinders are in need of slaves for their trading boats, and lay in wait for any raiders coming in for easy pickings. While life as a raider is inheriently a life of risk, this hits the clan harder than most times: a group of young clansmen, joining the easier raid for training, were captured as well. Amongst them was the already well respected 12 year old Strongarm, and capture by the Shell-Grinders is surely a fate worse than death."
    - For chiefton Fatechanger, this event marks the last straw and he becomes determined to rise the Cragmaw clan above it's lowly position.

  events:
    - Celebrations erupt through the village when a 16 year old, battle hardened Strongarm unexpectedly walks through the Great Stone Maw. Though most escape from the Shell-Grinders broken and hollow, Strongarm now walks with the confidence of a great warrior, and brings stories of the great treasure contained within the great cities of the northern coasts. Accompanying Strongarm is the silvertongued Wordsmith, now bound through blood debt. Though most of the clan is suspicious of the strange half Domer, Strongarm encourages Wordsmith to explain his plan to breach the walls of the Great City Jahpo to plunder the riches within.

  quote: "You may not like us, this I can see. You think us selfish, rude and untrustworthy. You may be right. But here we are, open in our self-interest - if nothing else, you can trust in shared selfishness."

  events: 
    - Darksand plays a crucial role in securing a union with Lesser King Rehohaim of the Tridents to execute on Wordsmiths wildly ambitious plan to raid Jahpo. Though initially weary of each other Darksand and Wordsmith work closely together to create a detailed plan - Darksand taps his deep knowledge of the elements and the world, Wordsmith knows in detail the logisitics and supply routes of the Great City Jahpo. Rehohaim's formidible ships attack from the coast, and serve both to distract the defenses and cut off supply lines while the Cragmaw raiders exploit weaknesses in the city's walls in short, terrifying attacks at unexpected hours of the day and night designed to exhaust those within.

  quote: "I find it fitting that the story of our fall begins with the greatest victories our people have ever seen."

  events:
    - In one year, everything changed.
    - Fatechanger dies aged 38 of fever, mere months before the campaign against the Shell-Grinders is set to begin. Stormglory, Fatechangers son, takes his place at age 16. Panic takes over as Rehohaims ships have already set sail, but quickly any doubts about Stormglorys leadership ability are assuaged as he proves to have an iniate sense of warfare, and a swift but just leadership ability. A faction supported Strongarms (now 19) bid to become leader but when Strongarm sees Stormglorys leadership, they quickly become their closest friends and Strongarm willingly withdraws his bid to become chiefton.
    - The 9 month long campaign against the Great City Jahpo is succesful beyond the clans wildest dreams, though some warriors leave the city changed after seeing the horrors that exist within.

- year: The 2nd year of Stormglory
  quote: "All clansmen will benefit from our victories! Now - we celebrate, as is our struggles reward!"

  events:
    - Word has spread throughout the lands of Cragmaws ballsy success, and the Shell-Grinders attempts at revenge have been weak, at best. They may be near unstoppable on the seas, but amongst the confusing landscape, far from allies, it seems they have given up. Stormglory uses their newfound reputation wisely, becoming a benefactor and protector of the local clans (a useful buffer against enemies) and leverging the fearsome reputation won to bring new concessions. As the clan saw the benefit of careful forethought that went into the Shell-Grinder campaign, the tragedies of the trident earlier, and under the influence of Darksand and Wordsmith, their culture slowly starts respecting intellegence and diplomacy over strength and force. Rumors spread of Stormglory being the leader that could unite both the North and Sound together - the rare ruler who is both strong and just. It is as if God himself approves of it, bringing heavy rains year after year that the cracked ground drinks up.
    - While many petition to join the clan, only a few are allowed the honor of calling themselves Cragmaw. Silverbow was one of the first, coming immediately after hearing the damage we brought to the Shell-Grinders, bringing with him advanced military knowledge, sophisticated scouting techniques and novel weapon construction.  Coincidently he also finds a lost wandering farmer, Sourgrass, who remembers nothing save for extensive details about growing food and jerry rigging together tools. Under their guidance both our farmers and warriors become mighty and respected throughout the land.
    -
    - Some later say they warned of the seeds of our downfall in the revelry of these and later years but they are liars - all were seen with the rest of the clan, drinking and singing through the night.

  events:
    - Chiefton Stormglory begins long term plans to expand the role of Cragmaw in the region. Against Darksands protests, he sends Strongarms 8 year old niece, whos parents were killed during the raids against the Shell-Grinders, off to study to become an oracle.

- year: The 7th year of Stormglory
  quote: "God is on our side! Can't you see that? He has plans for our people, we are destined to be so much more, we can do no wrong!"

  events: 
    - The rains have blessed the people of the Northlands for almost 8 years, as the fortunes of the Cragmaw Raiders, and the size of their bellies, continue to grow. But ever the contrarian, Darksand grows more and more bitter and cynical in proportion. As the oldest and wisest of the clan, he has final say over who and who can't join the clan, and by now he's turning everyone way, suspecting them of being spies. He has also been warning for years of the Saltmen traders, who stop by often, sometimes without any intention of purchasing anything. Most clansmen, Stormglory included, finds them quite pleasent (though a bit artifically so), even if they don't drink as much as the raiders do.
    - Darksand knows the ocean tide receeds just as surely as it advances, and the same with human fortune. He knows that the vultures great skill is not in finding things that are already dead, but in identifying and following those that are soon to die, and he knows that the Saltmen, if they are anything else, are vultures. His words, once respected, now fall on deaf ears, and people whisper that he's losing his sanity. Just the same, he harbors a strange respect for the wisdom of the Saltmen and privately wonders if his own backwards, sword clinging clan deserves it's inevitable downfall.

    - The year the rains stop.

  events: 
    - Though many say Sourgrass could grow a bouquet out of a rock, he struggles as the ground cracks and loses life. The Saltmen, with their extensive stores of grains and supplies, have been happy to trade the Cragmaw food for goods, to help the clan through this temporary tough time. Trading and raiding keeps their bellies fill and to a lesser extent the local vassal clans bellies too. But the results of this years inventory indicate that if the rain does not come next year, people will starve. 

- year: The 11th year of Stormglory
  events:
    - Longhair returns from her oracle studies and her presence brought comfort to the growing tensions.
    - But as before, in one year, everything changed.
