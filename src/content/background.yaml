- text: At one point, the imposing natural walls of Cragmaw meant many things to many different people. One of the few mountains in the area that could be seen from afar, the nearby local tribes saw an influence that stretched far beyond anything they knew - a potential ally when foreign forces attack, but also a force that demanded respect. The jagged, sharp rocks represented pure evil to the victims of the fast, skilled attacks of the raiders within; while the larger kingdoms scratched their beards scheming about the treasure and loot laying behind those towering walls.
- text: But that was then. Now the walls look like a thin barrier between the weakening occupants and an increasingly hostile outside. Now the tall source of pride for generations feels like a barren prison.
- text: It has been three years of no rain and now farmers only grow dust. The experienced raiders grumble as their brothers in arms practice with crude gardening equipment. Both inside and outside the stony walls rumors are spreading about how the chiefton grows quieter and quieter with each passing month, spending days consulting with the oracle or staring off westward, watching for any sign of clouds, leaving the details of raiding, farming, and conflict resolution to his advisors. The loot they once had has almost entirely been traded for meager amounts of food to the Saltmen to the south.

Everybody knows it - nobody mentions it, not even the drunkest loud mouth, not after how much the Chiefton has done for their people: he has earned their respect despite anything else. Nobody mentions it because everybody also knows that someday soon they will be faced with a choice. And maybe that's why the Chiefton stares off into the distance every day - he's alive for his own long drawn out funeral."
